Play Me
======
This is a .NET based office jukebox, created by Trade Me developers as part of FedEx Day 2012. 

It is made up of two main components: the player itself runs as a console application (on top of a Mongo database), and a Single Page Application hosted by IIS serves as the interface. 

Documentation is being added slowly, but hopefully there is enough here to get you up and running. Ready to run versions of the Server and the Website are zipped in the root of the repository if you'd like to use the software, and of course the source is there for anyone who wants to get stuck in!
